WhatsApp introduced flows, mobile-app screen like message types.

This type makes collecting user information a breeze and greatly improves your chatbot UX

JAWCE already comes out with support for flows. An example flow template will be as below
```yaml
"EXAMPLE_LOGIN_FLOW":
  type: flow
  message:
    id: flow-id
    draft: true
    name: flow-name
    title: "My Flow Title"
    body: "Flow message body"
    button: CTA
  routes:
    "re:.*": "NEXT_STAGE"
```

As you can see, JAWCE tries to keep template signature similar, a flow template can have a `title`, `body` and or `footer`
like any other interactive messages.
