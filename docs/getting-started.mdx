<Warning>
    I assume you have your WhatsApp account and credentials in place

Since JAWCE is developed with Java (porting to Kotlin WIP ðŸš§) it is natural that chatbot templates (conversation flow) are saved in the project
`src/main/resources/templates` folder.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone JAWCE" icon="git">
        Clone or download the JAWCE chatbot sample project:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:DonnC/jawce.git
        ```

        After successful clone, open the project in an IDE of your choice
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
        Install project maven dependencies

        From now on, we will focus on the `example` folder with the sample chatbot
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup Credentials" icon="user-lock">
        Remember the WhatsApp Credentials we mentioned?

        Navigate to the `/jchatbot/src/main/resources/application.yml` properties file and replace secret keys with your
        account credentials
        ```yaml
        chatbot:
            configs:
                # ...
                hub-token: "replace-with-your-hub-token"
                access-token: "replace-with-your-access-token"
                phone-number-id: "replace-with-your-phone-number-id"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test Run" icon="whatsapp">
        Before you run the project, setup the full path to the project resources folder

        ```yaml
        resources:
            templates: ..full/path/to/templates
            triggers: ..full/path/to/triggers
            watcher: ..full/path/to/watch
        ```

        E.g If you cloned the project in

        `C:\Users\me\projects\jawce`

        Your path folders will be as

        `C:\\Users\\me\\projects\\jawce\\example\\jchatbot\\src\\main\\resources\\templates`

        If all goes well,

        Start your development server

        Run the `chatbot` project, if all goes well. It should run on the port configured in the application properties file.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Webhook Config" icon="globe">
        If the example chatbot run successfully. You can configure `NGROK` to tunnel your local setup to obtain an HTTPS webhook
        to configure on Meta developer portal.

        In a new terminal, do
        ```bash
        ngrok http 8080
        ```

        The webhook url will be accessible on `https://ngrok-url/jawce/webhook` which you can use to configure on your meta developer application portal as below
