<Warning>I assume you have your WhatsApp account and credentials in place</Warning>

Since JAWCE is developed with Java (porting to Kotlin WIP ðŸš§) it is natural that chatbot templates (conversation flow) are saved in the project
`resources/templates` folder.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone JAWCE" icon="git">
        Clone or download the JAWCE chatbot sample project:

        ```bash
        gh repo clone DonnC/jawce
        ```

        After successful clone, open the project in an IDE of your choice
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
        Install project maven dependencies

        From now on, we will focus on the `chatbot` folder with the sample chatbot
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup Credentials" icon="user-lock">
        Remember the WhatsApp Credentials we mentioned?

        Navigate to the `/chatbot/src/main/resources/application.yml` properties file and replace secret keys with your
        account credentials
        ```yaml
        chatbot:
            configs:
                # ...
                hub-token: "replace-with-your-hub-token"
                access-token: "replace-with-your-access-token"
                phone-number-id: "replace-with-your-phone-number-id"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test Run" icon="whatsapp">
        Start your development server

        Run the `chatbot` project, if all goes well. It should run on the port configured in the application properties file.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Webhook Config" icon="globe">
        If the example chatbot run successfully. You can configure `NGROK` to tunnel your local setup to obtain an HTTPS webhook
        to configure on Meta developer portal.

        In a new terminal, do
        ```bash
        ngrok http 8080
        ```

        The webhook url will be accessible on `https://ngrok-url/jawce/webhook` which you can use to configure on your meta developer application portal as below
