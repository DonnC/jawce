<Warning>Documentation still in progress</Warning>

**JAWCE** - Java WhatsApp Cloud API Engine, is a free Open Source project, allowing you to create instant WhatsApp chatbot using the official WhatsApp Cloud API.

A project involving social media chatbot is always an exciting project to do, however creating a chatbot for WhatsApp has its challenges and is time consuming.
Many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, along with dealing with overheads such as session.

I developed **JAWCE** to cut development time and deliver (almost) instant, quick, easy chatbots as well as advanced ones by using template.

I created it as an `Engine` so that its separate from the actual chatbot logic.

You just focus on the chatbot conversation flow and the business logic - and leave the rest to the engine.

Features include:

- Out-of-the-box session management and implementations
- [Hooks](/hooks): Extend or add custom functionality by means of hooks.
- [Templates](/writing-templates): Create template based message flows for your users.
- [Extendable](/extend): Add as dependency to your Java code and use it coupled with business logic.

Other useful features include:

- Configurable
- Support for WhatsApp Flows
- Message debounce to avoid processing repetitive webhook messages

## Should I use JAWCE?
Maybe not - but it won't hurt to try. Take JAWCE for a spin and let me know your experience.
