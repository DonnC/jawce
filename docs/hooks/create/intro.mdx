title: Creating Hooks
description: Supercharge your template with hooks
---
Hooks are nothing more than regular Java classes or your normal REST API endpoints.

<Info>
    Java hooks takes advantage of JAVA Reflection API
</Info>

You can mix both approaches anyway you want. Java classes will only work if you extend the engine (more in the Advanced section).

Since JAWCE attempts to run as a standalone engine, you can as well have all your hooks as REST endpoints to your system backend.

All hooks should accept a child of `DefaultHookArg` model as a request body or as a constructor argument.

`DefaultHookArg` has 2 subclasses which are `HookArgs` for Java classes hooks and `HookArgsRest` for REST based hooks.

<Warning>
    All `REST API` based hooks should be a POST request that accepts and returns a `HookArgsRest` model.
</Warning>

<Warning>
    All `Java classes` based hooks should have a constructor which takes `HookArgs` model as a parameter.
</Warning>

## Hook model

<CodeGroup title="Hook Model: HookArgs">
    ```java
    public record WaCurrentUser(
        String name,        // default user display name
        String waId,        // mobile number
        String msgId,
        ) {}

    public record TemplateDynamicBody(
        WebhookResponseMessageType type,        // for dynamic template message type
        Map<String, Object> payload,            // used for `flow` type - initial flow data
        Map<String, Object> renderPayload       // dynamic template data
        ) {}

    // main model
    public class HookArgs {
        private WaCurrentUser channelUser;
        private String userInput;                           // user input from whatsapp
        private String flow;                                // flow name for flow template type
        private Map<String, Object> additionalData;         // mainly for dynamic routing
        private TemplateDynamicBody templateDynamicBody;
        private Map<String, Object> methodArgs;             // provided static params defined on template
    }
    ```

    ```python
    class ChannelUser(BaseModel):
        name: str
        waId: str
        msgId: str
        timestamp: int

    class TemplateDynamicBody(BaseModel):
        type: Union[str, None] = None
        payload: Union[dict, None] = None
        renderPayload: Union[dict, None] = None


    # main model
    class HookArgs(BaseModel):
        channelUser: ChannelUser
        userInput: Union[str, None] = None
        flow: Union[str, None] = None
        additionalData: Union[dict, None] = None
        templateDynamicBody: Union[TemplateDynamicBody, None] = None
        methodArgs: Union[dict, None] = None
    ```

    The Hook model contains all the necessary data you can use in your business logic
