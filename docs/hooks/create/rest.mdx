title: REST API Hooks
description: REST API endpoint based hook

REST API based hooks gives JAWCE powers to connect to any other system or backend of your choice.

One strict rule will be that, your endpoints must be a POST request which accepts a `HookArgsRest` model as explained before.

To link a REST API hook, prefix it with `rest:<your-http(s)-endpoint>` as below

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  on-receive: "rest:https://example.com/api/notify"
  message: "Type `yes` to receive a Slack notification from us"
  routes:
    "yes": "next-stage"
```

An example endpoint implementation will be as below (Python Example)
```python
# ...
# using FAST API

@app.post("/notify")
def slack_notify(args: HookArgsRest):
    print("Received args: {}".format(args))

    # assume user once provided their slack email before
    # & is stored in session as a prop
    slack_id = get_slack_id_from_props(session_id=args.channelUser.waId)

    # check if user answered yes
    if args.userInput.lower() == "yes":
        send_slack_notification(id=slack_id)

    return args
```

# Endpoint Security
You must be wondering, what if my endpoint has API-KEYs or some sort of security. The engine has an internal session key: `SessionConstants.HOOK_USER_SESSION_ACCESS_TOKEN`

If your bot has login functionality, you can save the secret key in a session under this key and the engine will check this and add as Authorization header when calling your endpoint

<Info>
    By default, the engine assume, access token is a Bearer auth token
