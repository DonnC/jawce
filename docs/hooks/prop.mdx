title: Prop
description: Save arbitrary user data to session / cache
---
If you have been developing websites, you probably come across this word. Here, Props are custom variables that you can use however you'd like -
to store data in the user session under that variable.

The engine keeps track of the user session props internally.

## Defining a prop

To define a prop on a particular template, provide the `prop` attr with your defined variable name

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  prop: userName
  message: "What is your name?"
  routes:
    "re:\\w+": next-stage
```

In the above, when user provides a response, it will be saved in the user session props under the key `userName`

PS: The default chatbot comes with `file-based session manager` implementation. So you can view this file anytime and see
how the data is being used

You can then access this user session data in your bot logic.

# Managing Session Data
Depending on your Session Manager implementation, you might not be able to view the session data plainly.

The example bot comes with a helper endpoint to play around with session data

```
[PUT request] <bot-url>/jawce/api/session
```

Request payload
```kotlin
enum class SessionAction {
    CLEAR,
    ADD,
    EVICT,
    FETCH
}

data class SessionRequest(
    val action: SessionAction,
    val sessionId: String,      // user session id (phone number)
    val key: String?,           // session key to save or fetch
    val data: Any?              // session data to save
)
```

PS: You can provide `*` as key to fetch all user session data
