description: Render different message types to the user
---
The message field is a required field in the template. The message depends on the template `type`

The engine supports the following types
- text
- button
- list
- flow
- dynamic
- location
and more

Let's look at the most common ones

## TEXT
The general message type, this shows a generic text message.
```yaml
2000:
  type: text
  message: "Kindly provide your preferred date and time in 24hr format"
  routes:
    "re:.*": 3000
```

or

```yaml
2000:
  type: text
  prop: bookingDate
  message:
    - "Kindly provide your preferred date and time in 24hr format"
    - ""
    - "Format: _DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM_ \ne.g *23/05/2024 10:00*"
  routes:
    "re:.*": 3000
```


## BUTTON
Shows a button to the user. The buttons should be **NOT** more that 3 button options. The button name will be
the button id. You can use the button name in the `routes` field to match the clicked button id

```yaml
"BOOK_STAGE":
  type: button
  message:
    title: Book Demo
    body: "Great, confirm your booking request by clicking the start button"
    buttons:
      - Start
      - Return
  routes:
    "start": 1000
    "return": "MAIN_MENU"
```

## LIST
This gives a user a list of options to select from. The list can have section titles to divide your list items. Note that a list 
should have at most **10 items**. Each list item will be matched by its item id in the `routes` field. The `description` is optional.

```yaml
1000:
  type: list
  message:
    title: "System"
    body: "Great choice, select your ERP of choice from the options below"
    button: "Select ERP"
    sections:
      "ERP Systems":        # <- section title
        0:                  # <- items (rows) under that section
          title: ERPNext
          description: A versatile, open-source ERP
        1:
          title: Odoo
          description: A versatile open-source system for a medium organization
        2:
          title: SAP
          description: A commercial ERP for medium-large organization
        "other":
          title: Other
  routes:
    0: 2000
    1: 3000
    2: 4000
    "other": 5000
```

Each id will be used to match the `route` and the next stage to go to.
