description: Supercharge your template

Hooks supercharge the **JAWCE** engine. It makes it possible to hook custom, additional functionality during message processing.

You want to send a Slack notification when user confirms their order? Add a hook.

How about to dynamically populate a message with some dynamic variables? Add a hook!

# How hooks are processed
Imagine user starts your chatbot for the first time.

The engine checks for this in the session, and takes the first menu your configure in the `properties` file as the first template.

It evaluates this current template hooks and processes all PRE-HOOKs defined if any.

It processes & renders the template and send to user.

When user respond to that message, the engine lookup that template as the current template and process its POST-HOOKS

The process repeats on and on 😶‍🌫️

There a number of hooks that you can define in your template, the engine will do its best to handle the rest.

Below are some of the "hooks" and the other "fields" or "attributes" you can define in your templates

- type - type of message to render
- prop
- on-receive
- on-generate
- validator
- middleware
- template
- params
- message
- routes
and much more

You can probably guess what other hooks does by their name.

Hooks are categorized into `POST` or `PRE` hooks


## Pre Hooks
These are processed **BEFORE** the message is rendered and send to the user on WhatsApp.

> In the order which they are processed

These include
- params
- template
- on-generate

## Post Hooks
These hooks are processed **AFTER** the user responds to a message.

> In the order which they are processed

- params
- validator
- on-receive
- middleware
- prop


## Hooks processing
Hooks supports both RESTful based hooks and Java classes (using Reflection API) (`more on this later`)

All `REST API` based hooks should be a POST request that accepts and returns a `HookArgs` model

<CodeGroup title="Hook Model: HookArgs">
```java
public record WaCurrentUser(
        String name,        // display name
        String waId,        // mobile number
        String msgId,       // message id
        Long timestamp      // message timestamp
) {
}

public record TemplateDynamicBody(
        WebhookResponseMessageType type,        // for dynamic template message type
        Map<String, Object> payload,            // used for `flow` type - initial flow data
        Map<String, Object> renderPayload       // dynamic template data
) {
}

// main model
public class HookArgs {
    private WaCurrentUser channelUser;
    private String userInput;                           // user input from whatsapp
    private String flow;                                // flow name for flow template type
    private Map<String, Object> additionalData;
    private TemplateDynamicBody templateDynamicBody;
    private Map<String, Object> methodArgs;             // params to pass to hook if defined in template
}
```

```python
class ChannelUser(BaseModel):
    name: str
    waId: str
    msgId: str
    timestamp: int

class TemplateDynamicBody(BaseModel):
    type: Union[str, None] = None
    payload: Union[dict, None] = None
    renderPayload: Union[dict, None] = None


# main model
class HookArgs(BaseModel):
    channelUser: ChannelUser
    userInput: Union[str, None] = None
    flow: Union[str, None] = None
    additionalData: Union[dict, None] = None
    templateDynamicBody: Union[TemplateDynamicBody, None] = None
    methodArgs: Union[dict, None] = None
```
