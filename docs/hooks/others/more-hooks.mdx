title: More Hook
description: A lot more on hooks

In this section, let's quickly go through more hooks
- params
- router
- checkpoint

# Params
Ever wanted to pass custom static data to your hooks? Use params (like functions parameters / method arguments)

<Info>
    Params can be applied to any type of message
</Info>

Let's take a look at an example
```yaml
100:
  type: button
  on-receive: "com.example.jawce.service.AccountHook:processAccountRequest"
  message:
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    account-type: Individual
    currency: ZAR
  routes:
    "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
```

In your business logic hook, you can get the passed params as below
```java
class AccountHook {
    private final HookArgs args;

    public AccountHook(HookArgs args) {
        this.args = args;
    }

    public Object processAccountRequest() {
        log.info("Process account args: {}", args);

        // access params
        var params = args.getMethodArgs();

        if(params.get("currency").equals("ZAR")) {
            // handle logic
        }

        return args;
    }
}
```

# Router
The only job for this hook is to provide dynamic routing.

Wondering how to dynamically redirect user to a certain stage? Use the router to act as a route decider switch.

```yaml
100:
  type: button
  router: "com.example.jawce.service.AccountHook:routeSwitcher"
  message:
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    currency: USD
  routes:
    "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
```

<Info>
        `EngineConstants.REST_HOOK_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY` is an internal engine constant used to set the next dynamic route
</Info>


In your business logic hook, you can redirect user to another route like below
```java
class AccountHook {
    private final HookArgs args;

    public AccountHook(HookArgs args) {
        this.args = args;
    }

    public Object routeSwitcher() {
        log.info("Route switcher args: {}", args);

        // access params
        var params = args.getMethodArgs();

        if(params.get("currency").equals("ZAR")) {
            args.setAdditionalData(
                    Map.of(
                            EngineConstants.REST_HOOK_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY,
                            "REQUEST_ZAR_ACC_DETAILS_STAGE"  // redirect to route
                    )
            );

            return args;
        }

        return args;
    }
}
```

# Checkpoint
Save a stage as a last access point: checkpoint.

One use case is to take your users back to their latest previous menu instead of taking them back to the very start menu.

# Ack (Bluetick âœ…)
As it says, it makes you acknowledge reception of a message (bluetick) on WhatsApp
