# Add as a dependency
In case you don't want to run the engine as a standalone service or want to do things your own way.
You can add the engine as a dependency to your existing project to couple it together with your business logic.

First, fork or clone the repository and build the engine.

In your `pom.xml` dependencies add the following

```xml
<!-- your other dependencies -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>zw.co.dcl.jawce</groupId>
    <artifactId>jawce-java-engine</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Make sure you create a rest controller which handles 2 of the important logic
- webhook verification
- webhook payload
