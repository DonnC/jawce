The sample project you just ran comes with default configurations.
A lot of configurations can be overridden too but for simplicity only these are used in the sample project.

```yaml
resources:
  templates: ..full/path/to/templates/dir
  triggers: ..full/path/to/triggers/dir
  watcher: ..full/path/to/watch/dir
  hooks:
    base-url: "http://localhost:${server.port}${server.servlet.context-path}"
    security-token: "hook-url-auth-token"

chatbot:
  configs:
    initial-stage: "START-MENU"
    session-ttl: 30
    hub-token: "replace-with-your-hub-token"
    access-token: "replace-with-your-access-token"
    phone-number-id: "replace-with-your-phone-number-id"

server:
  servlet:
    context-path: /jawce
  port: 8080
```

### Resources
The resources section defines where to find the templates and triggers.

Configure the full path to where the resources are, for example. If you clone the project in `C:\\Projects` folder, it will be like below

```yaml
resources:
  templates: C:\\Projects\\jawce\\example\\jchatbot\\src\\main\\resources\\templates
  triggers:  C:\\Projects\\jawce\\example\\jchatbot\\src\\main\\resources\\triggers
  watcher:   C:\\Projects\\jawce\\example\\jchatbot\\src\\main\\resources\\watch
```

The `watcher` is used to listen to file changes in the `watch` dir which will trigger all templates to reload without restarting the service.

The `hooks` is a powerful feature which enables the engine to make request calls to external service where your chatbot logic sits (usually your local running server).

The `security-token` is a security credential to send in your hook requests. This can be for a secured hook endpoint using JWT, Bearer Token or any security
token you implement.

### Chatbot
These configs are mainly to include your WhatsApp account credentials.
